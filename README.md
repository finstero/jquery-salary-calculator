# Salary Calculator

Duration: 3 Day Sprint

## Description

This is a minimalist program to calculate monthly costs based on employee salaries input into page by user.
Takes employee first name, last name, ID, Title, and annual salary. Stores data as array of employee objects.

*Requires that annual salary be input WITHOUT dollar sign or comma.
*Requires that annual salary be included before program will push employee to array
*Allows that other information NOT be input, as long as salary is there. This option can be changed easily.

Includes option to delete employee and re calculate costs. Deletes employee from DOM and from array on clicking 
respective delete button.
Will alert user using window pop up and red background if monthly costs exceed $20,000.

Project created using Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
